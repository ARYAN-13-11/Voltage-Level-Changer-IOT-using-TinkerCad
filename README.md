# Voltage-Level-Changer-IOT-using-TinkerCad
This project demonstrates a simple Voltage Level Indicator using an Arduino Uno, a potentiometer, and 5 LEDs. The system measures the voltage level using a potentiometer and represents the voltage range visually by lighting up LEDs. As the voltage increases, more LEDs light up, providing an easy-to-understand representation of the voltage level.
